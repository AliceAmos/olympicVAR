Just configure the IDE's run configuration to main.py script - all the commands are there on the right order.

To change the video that it is predicting on - just change the url of it (passed as first parameter to predict() func.)

To change the model that is predicting (not that you need to do so... not relevant for your development), just change the 'frames_predicton_model_path' variable.


Requirements reminder:

- Need to get the url of the video that was uploaded to CF by the user (which is me).
- Need to be able to return that predicted score (that is calculated on main file) to the UI, to be shown on screen.
